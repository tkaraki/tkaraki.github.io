                  <h3>Hi, my name is Tala</h3>
                  <p>Iâ€™m a computer science senior at Washington State University in Pullman, WA.</p>
                  <p>Previously, I was an electrical and computer engineering student at the American University of Beirut in Lebanon. 
                    After moving to the US, I changed gears, embraced my passions, and delved into the tech sphere.</p>
                  <h3>Currently </h3>
                  <p>Today, I am a software engineering and computer science student at WSU. </p>
                    <p>I enjoy designing and building programs, be it applications, websites, or anything in between. 
                    My goal is to consistently create products that provide seamless, effective experiences for all of its users. 
                    I always endeavor to expand my knowledge and skillset, mostly through occupying myself with other projects. </p>
                    <p>I was an undergraduate research assistant with the software engineering lab, where I was able to conduct literature reviews and build an eye-tracker program.</p>
                    <p>Most recently, I was a solution architect intern at Dell Technologies with the presales team. 
                    Other than learning about the organization's tech stack, I also designed a mobile application for a nonprofit to be deployed on IOS and Android.
                    The Flutter app was built with backend data storage, real-time synchronization, and user-event logging using Google Firebase. </p>
        
                    <p> </p>
                    
                    <p>In between coding and researching, I enjoy drawing, painting, and talking to people. 
                    I am currently a mentor to women undergraduates at the Voiland College of Engineering in WSU.
                    Engaging and supporting women in STEM is a mission that is very important to me. 
                    Before moving to the US, I led a workshop for over 60 girls with UNICEF to promote digital literacy and narrow the technological knowledge gap.</p> 
                  
                  <h3>Up Next</h3>
                  <p> My classes and work experience have been insightful.
                     <p> I love technology, but I also love people.</p>
                      <p>I enjoy building applications, but also designing art.</p>
                      <p>My next move is to combine all of the above into my career. </p></p>
